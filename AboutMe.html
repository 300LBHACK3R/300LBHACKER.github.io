  <!-- About Section (add "fade-in" to animate on scroll if desired) -->
  <section id="about-me" class="fade-in">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><strong>I am a dedicated Network IT & Security professional</strong> with a passion for solving complex problems through innovative technology solutions. With a strong foundation in programming, ethical hacking, and system administration, I thrive on challenges that push the boundaries of what is possible. I love diving into self-driven projects, exploring new tools, and staying ahead of the curve with the latest tech and security updates.</p>
    <p>Whether it is designing secure networks, analyzing vulnerabilities, or crafting custom solutions, I am driven by a commitment to excellence and a relentless love for continuous learning. Technology isn’t just my profession—it’s my passion, and I am always eager to apply my skills to make a meaningful impact.</p>
    <p>But it is not all circuits and code in my world. When I am not troubleshooting network issues, you might find me strumming the guitar or tickling the ivories on the piano. Music is a huge part of my life, fueling my creativity and keeping my spirits high. I also hit the gym for some boxing, keeping both my mind and body sharp. And when it comes to full stack development, I am all in—constantly blending the art of design with the science of code.</p>
    <p>Let us build a safer, smarter, and more connected world together—one byte, beat, and RAT at a time!</p>
