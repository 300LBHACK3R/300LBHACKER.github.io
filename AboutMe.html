<!-- About Section -->
<section id="About Me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a dedicated Network IT & Security professional with a passion for solving complex problems through innovative
    technology solutions. With a strong foundation in programming, ethical hacking, and system administration, I thrive on
    challenges that push the boundaries of what is possible. I love diving into self-driven projects, exploring new tools,
    and staying ahead of the curve with the latest tech and security updates.
    
    Whether it is designing secure networks, analyzing vulnerabilities, or crafting custom solutions, I am driven by a
    commitment to excellence and a relentless love for continuous learning. Technology isn it just my profession it is my
    passion, and I am always eager to apply my skills to make a meaningful impact.
    
    But it is not all circuits and code in my world. When I am not troubleshooting network issues, you might find me strumming
    the guitar or tickling the ivories on the piano. Music is a huge part of my life, fueling my creativity and keeping my
    spirits high. I also hit the gym for some boxing, keeping both my mind and body sharp. And when it comes to full Stack
    development, I am all in constantly blending the art of design with the science of code.
    
    Let us build a safer, smarter, and more connected world together—one byte, beat, and RAT at a time!</p>
